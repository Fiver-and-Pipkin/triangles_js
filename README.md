========

Triangles is a simple program that allows a user to enter three side lengths of a triangle to find out whether they have created a triangle that is equilateral (all sides are equal), isosceles (exactly 2 sides are equal), scalene (no sides are equal), or a combination that does not equate to a valid triangle.
